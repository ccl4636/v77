title: "NeuralPower: Predict and Deploy Energy-Efficient Convolutional Neural
  Networks"
abstract: "“How much energy is consumed for an inference made by a convolutional neural
  network (CNN)?” With the increased popularity of CNNs deployed on the wide-spectrum
  of platforms (from mobile devices to workstations), the answer to this question
  has drawn significant attention. From lengthening battery life of mobile devices
  to reducing the energy bill of a datacenter, it is important to understand the energy
  efficiency of CNNs during serving for making an inference, before actually training
  the model. In this work, we propose NeuralPower: a layer-wise predictive framework based
  on sparse polynomial regression, for predicting the serving energy consumption of
  a CNN deployed on any GPU platform. Given the architecture of a CNN, NeuralPower provides
  an accurate prediction and breakdown for power and runtime across all layers in
  the whole network, helping machine learners quickly identify the power, runtime,
  or energy bottlenecks. We also propose the “energy-precision ratio” (EPR)
  metric to guide machine learners in selecting an energy-efficient CNN architecture
  that better trades off the energy consumption and prediction accuracy. The experimental
  results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed NeuralPower outperforms the best
  published model to date, yielding an improvement in accuracy of up to 68.5%. We
  also assess the accuracy of predictions at the network level, by predicting the
  runtime, power, and energy of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, achieving an average
  accuracy of 88.24% in runtime, 88.34% in power, and 97.21% in energy. We comprehensively
  corroborate the effectiveness of NeuralPower as a powerful framework for machine learners
  by testing it on different GPU platforms and Deep Learning software tools."
